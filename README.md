[![UT](https://github.com/alexkater/MarvelApp/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/alexkater/MarvelApp/actions/workflows/tests.yml)
## Purpose
This app is just an example on how to use Composable Architecture from pointfree.co

## Demo

## Decisions
- Used Composable Architecture as Redux is a good match with SwiftUI
- Used ImageURL as external dependency just for simplicity
- Used Snapshot testing to prevent UI Changes
- Added unit tests for Reducers and Services
